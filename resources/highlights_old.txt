If you are dealing with a person who is socializing or cooperative with you, his or her feet should mirror your own. If, however, someone’s feet are pointed away from you while his body faces toward you, you should ask yourself why.

When a person talks to you with feet pointed away, it is a good indication this person wants to be elsewhere. Watch for people who make formal declarations in this position, as this is a form of distancing.

Their hands don’t touch as much, and their torsos actually avoid each other. When they sit side by side, they will lean away from each other. They create a silent space between them, and when they are forced to sit next to each other, such as in the back of an automobile, they will only rotate toward each other with their heads, not their bodies.

A very powerful way to let others know that you agree with them, or are consciously contemplating what they are saying, is to lean toward them or to ventrally front them. This tactic is especially effective when you are in a meeting and you don’t have the opportunity to speak up.

Men, for whatever the reason (perhaps to be less conspicuous), will shield their torsos, but in more subtle ways. A male may reach across the front of himself to play with his watch, or, as Prince Charles of England often does when he is in public, reach over and adjust his shirtsleeve or play with his cuff links. A man may also fix his tie knot, perhaps longer than usual, as this allows for the arm to cover the ventral area of the chest and neck. These are forms of shielding that transmit that the person is slightly insecure at that moment.

The stressed individual’s chest is heaving because the limbic brain is saying, “Potential problem—step up oxygen consumption in case we suddenly have to escape or fight!” When you see this type of nonverbal behavior in an otherwise healthy person, you should consider why he or she is so stressed.

Full and slight shoulder shrugs can mean a lot in context. When the boss asks an employee, “Do you know anything about this customer’s complaint?” and the employee answers, “No,” while giving a half shrug, chances are the speaker is not committed to what was just said.

The key action here is that the shoulders rise slowly. The person displaying this body language is basically trying to make his head disappear, like a turtle. Such an individual is lacking confidence and is highly uncomfortable.

I know for a certainty that this opening sentence will be off-putting to a large number of people and frankly I’d much prefer they read someone else’s business book full of ear-tickling clichés like “follow your passion,” “work hard,” “hire the right people,” blah blah blah. If that’s what you’re after, then search Amazon. There’ll be a gazillion business
